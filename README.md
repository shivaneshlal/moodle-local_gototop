# moodle-local_gototop
The local_gototop plugin for Moodle adds a "Go to Top" button to the user interface. This button appears when the user scrolls down the page and allows them to quickly return to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling animation. The button is styled as a circular button with an up arrow icon from FontAwesome.
